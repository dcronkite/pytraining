    "\n",
    "Pandas is _THE_ data science library for Python. It's built on top of a variety of very good and very fast numerical computing Python libraries. If you're familiar with R, Pandas was essentially an R clone, although it has developed and grown over the past decade...not to mention that it also bears the power of Python behind it. It's integration with `jupyter notebooks` makes Pandas excel, and allows for the use of documented, repeatable data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is entirely Python code, but the syntax doesn't feel quite python-y.\n",
