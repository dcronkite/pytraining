# Python Tutorials

## 000- Introduction/Setup/Install

### Install Python/Anaconda

* https://www.anaconda.com/download/
    * 3.x Version
* Install git too: https://git-for-windows.github.io/

### How to use

* IDEs
    * PyCharm Community
    * PyDev (Eclipse)
    * Visual Studio
* Text editors (Name your file ".py")
    * Visual Studio Code
    * Sublime
    * Atom
    * Notepad++
* Run `python example.py` from command line

## 001- Data Structures
Introduction to the fundamental datatypes in Python along with the basic data structures. These are the building blocks of Python programs and pre-requisite for using the language.

## 002- Loops/Exceptions

* if/elif/else - no case statements
* For/while loops
* Break/continue/pass
* Exceptions

### Example
The motivating example will either be iterating through a directory structure, or traversing a data file.

## 003- Functions and Iterators
Functions allow code re-use, as well as some other Python *magic* like iterators.

* Function syntax
* Recursion
* Iterators
    * yield statement

## 004- Functions and Classes

### Functions
Revisit functions
Recursion

### Classes
Introduction to Python objects and object-oriented programming.

### Extra
Datetime


## 005- Classes and the Standard Library

### Quickly Revisit Classes

### Standard Library

* Reading documentation
* Using the libraries

### Regular Expressions

* Using regular expressions

### Logging
An example will be provided using the `logging` module.

## 006- Connecting to Data: SQL

### Beyond the Standard Library
An introduction to packages outside the standard library.

* Finding a library that fits your needs
* Determine quality of library by looking at:
    * Github (how recently updated?)
    * Documentation (tutorials/examples?)
    * Stackoverflow (are people actually using?)
* Using pip/conda
    * Built-in to Anaconda
    * Validate non built-in

### pyodbc
Understanding basics of connection to a SQL datasource.

### SQLAlchemy
Advanced connections, and using an ORM.

### Writing Code to Ease Use
Setting up SQL Alchemy can unnecessarily complicate basic code, so it can be helpful to write your own 'wrappers' around the code to ease use. Share my own library. Introduce git.

## 007- Building a GUI

### Motivate GUI
Similar to setting up a chart abstraction tool, etc. This can provide a helpful interface from which to access code already written. Motivation: GUI for searching directory structure

### tkinter
Introduce a GUI library.

### Build a GUI
A GUI for searching directory structure


## 008- Building a Website

### Motivating Web Server
Another type of GUI, but with different advantages/disadvantages.

### Introducing Flask
Flask framework.

### Building a Chart Abstraction Interface
Example to show how to build out a website.

## 009- Data Science with Python: Pandas

### Introduction to Pandas Data Structure

* Series
* Dataframe

### Example Dataset
Work with and evaluate a sample dataset.

## 010- Advanced Pandas: Data Cleaning
Use a 'dirty' dataset, and show steps to clean and analyze the data. This will provide a detailed look at how to use pandas to pick apart a dataset.


## 011- Data Visualization: Concepts and Pandas

### Principles of Visualization

### Visualization in Pandas


## 012- Plotting
Introduce some visualization libraries.

* matplotlib
* seaborn
* plot.ly


## 013- Advanced Plotting

## 014- Advanced Topics
This is more of a placeholder for certain advanced topics, depending on interest. Including:

* Typing
* Useful modules in the standard library
* Python by inspection
* Context managers
* Packaging


## 015- Machine Learning Intro
An introduction to machine learning using the scikit-learn library.


## 016- Advanced Data Analytics
Using Python to download and clean a dataset, explore the variables, and then create a model to predict outcomes using the variables. This will use pandas, a plotting library, and scikit-learn.
