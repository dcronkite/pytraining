"""
find_in_directory.py
Recursively iterate through files/directories for specified parameters.
# Steps (for homeworks)
## HW005:
1. Run the file. Go to the containing directory and run:
    `python find_in_directory H:\...`
2. A shell has been created which runs, but it is worth figuring out exactly what
    everything is doing. Include some print statements to see what is happening.
3. Write a regular expression that detects (pick one):
    * a word (hard-code, or supply from command line)
    * PHI (what regular expressions would catch this)
4. Include print statements into the program to record what you found.
    * If the window disappears too quickly, pipe these to a file
        *  `python find_in_directory.py H:\... >> out.log`
    * Instead of printing, write to a file
        # add the paths where something was found to a found_items list
        found_items.append((path, 'Found word'))
        for path, note in found_items:
            with open('out.log', 'w') as out:
                out.write(f'{note} in file {path}'.
## HW006:
1. What additional filetypes can you search for? (csv? sas? html?)
2. You can keep the path updated correctly with `os.path.join(root, file)`
    * try printing this out
## HW007:
1. You have learned how to read in some Office doc types. Try adding them to this file
2. Read SAS7BDAT files too with this library: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sas7bdat
    * Reach out if you have trouble with the documentation
## HW008:
1. Design (on paper) a GUI with the functionality you want to add
    * You will need a space to specify a directory
    * You will want options to specify:
        * Which files?
        * Which words?
        * Regular expression?
    * You will want to see the output
        * Write to file?
        * Display on form
2. Build one element at a time, and test to make sure it works
