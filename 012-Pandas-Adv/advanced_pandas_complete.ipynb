    "Pandas: \"Python Data Analysis Library\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is _THE_ data science library for Python. It's built on top of a variety of very good and very fast numerical computing Python libraries. If you're familiar with R, Pandas was essentially an R clone, although it has developed and grown over the past decade...not to mention that it also bears the power of Python behind it. It's integration with jupyter notebooks makes Pandas excel, and allows for the use of documented, repeatable data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is entirely Python code, but the syntax doesn't feel quite python-y.\n",

    "2. Copy vs View: Some operations create a copy of the existing DataFrame, while others only create a View of the DataFrame so that the same data is used. Usually, when filtering, you get a View, while at other times you can get a Copy. With the View, any changes to data will affect the original dataframe, whereas this is not the case in a Copy. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A COPY, call `.copy()` explicitly.\n",
